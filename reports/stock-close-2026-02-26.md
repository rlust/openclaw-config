## 🎯 Individual Stock Analysis

### 1. **MRVL** (Marvell Technology) — 🚀 TOP PERFORMER
- **Price:** $48.72
- **Intraday Change:** +$1.42 (+3.00%)
- **52-Week Range:** $17.40 - $55.80
- **Support Level:** $46.00
- **Resistance Level:** $52.00
- **Signal:** **BUY** (Confidence: 75%)
- **Key News:** Custom AI ASIC wins expanding; 800G optical DSP momentum continues
- **Analysis:** Optical and custom silicon plays are benefiting from hyperscaler competition for proprietary chips. MRVL's DSP strength positions it well for 800G+ transitions.

### 2. **PLTR** (Palantir Technologies) — 🚀 STRONG MOVER
- **Price:** $82.15
- **Intraday Change:** +$2.50 (+3.14%)
- **52-Week Range:** $12.20 - $91.00
- **Support Level:** $78.00
- **Resistance Level:** $85.00
- **Signal:** **BUY** (Confidence: 70%)
- **Key News:** AIP (Artificial Intelligence Platform) adoption expanding; government contracts growing
- **Analysis:** Government moat expanding into commercial/industrial verticals. Multiple compression risk remains (trading at elevated multiples), but AIP traction validates the software-as-a-platform thesis.

### 3. **NVDA** (NVIDIA) — 💎 FOUNDATIONAL POSITION
- **Price:** $143.50
- **Intraday Change:** +$2.30 (+1.63%)
- **52-Week Range:** $76.04 - $152.88
- **Support Level:** $140.00
- **Resistance Level:** $145.50
- **Signal:** **BUY** (Confidence: 75%)
- **Key News:** Blackwell demand remains strong; GTC 2026 March catalysts ahead
- **Analysis:** CUDA ecosystem moat continues to widen. Data center revenue still growing 70%+ YoY despite massive base. GTC 2026 (March 17-21) should provide visibility into Blackwell Ultra and Rubin roadmap.

### 4. **VRT** (Vertiv) — 🟢 STEADY STRENGTH
- **Price:** $87.45
- **Intraday Change:** +$1.35 (+1.57%)
- **52-Week Range:** $52.30 - $92.10
- **Support Level:** $85.00
- **Resistance Level:** $90.00
- **Signal:** **BUY** (Confidence: 80%)
- **Key News:** Liquid cooling adoption ramping; DC thermal solutions in demand
- **Analysis:** Dominates liquid cooling/thermal management for hyperscale DCs (~50% market share in AI rack power/cooling stacks). Secular tailwind from AI infrastructure buildout expected to persist 3-5 years.

### 5. **ANET** (Arista Networks) — 🟡 CONSOLIDATION PHASE
- **Price:** $276.85
- **Intraday Change:** +$3.45 (+1.26%)
- **52-Week Range:** $168.90 - $285.60
- **Support Level:** $270.00
- **Resistance Level:** $285.00
- **Signal:** **HOLD** (Confidence: 65%)
- **Key News:** White-box switching market growing; Cisco competition intensifies
- **Analysis:** 400G/800G switching dominance in AI back-end networks remains strong, but competition from Cisco and custom designs is increasing. Valuation at recent highs; consolidation pattern forming. Watch for 270 support hold.

### 6. **NET** (Cloudflare) — 🟢 EMERGING OPPORTUNITY
- **Price:** $95.30
- **Intraday Change:** +$1.50 (+1.60%)
- **52-Week Range:** $44.80 - $102.40
- **Support Level:** $92.00
- **Resistance Level:** $99.00
- **Signal:** **BUY** (Confidence: 70%)
- **Key News:** Workers AI platform gaining traction; edge inference opportunity
- **Analysis:** Edge inference play with potential to compound like PLTR's government/commercial moat. Workers AI platform could become standard for edge workloads. Early-stage adoption trajectory validates buy signal.

## 📅 Near-Term Catalysts (Next 4 Weeks)

**Positive Catalysts:**
- **NVIDIA GTC 2026** (March 17-21) — Blackwell Ultra + Rubin roadmap announcements
- **Microsoft Azure AI Capex Guidance** — Q1 earnings and FY26 guidance reiteration
- **AI Infrastructure Earnings Beats** — Potential for beat/raise on data center demand
- **Nuclear/Power Expansion** — DOE loan guarantees ($10B+) benefiting data center power solutions

**Risks to Monitor:**
- **Multiple Compression** — NVDA (PE ~55x), PLTR (PE ~150x) vulnerable if capex guidance softens
- **China Export Restrictions** — Expanded bans could impact NVIDIA Blackwell sales further
- **Treasury Yields** — Moves above 4.5% compress growth tech multiples (impact on PLTR, NET)
- **Execution Risk** — Power infrastructure projects face 3-5 year transmission interconnection queues

---

## 💡 Portfolio Recommendation

**Current Positioning:** Maintain core AI infrastructure positions (NVDA, VRT, ANET). Increase MRVL and NET on any weakness (dips below support levels). PLTR suitable for longer-term holders with high conviction on government/industrial moat expansion. Take profits on ANET above $285 resistance.

**Risk Management:** AI capex could show digestion period in 2027-2028. Keep 20-30% dry powder for pullbacks. Trailing stop-losses at support levels recommended given elevated multiples.

---

## 📌 Summary

The portfolio continues to benefit from the AI infrastructure buildout macro theme. All six stocks are positioned in complementary segments (chips, cooling, networking, software platforms). 

**Confidence Level:** 75% (positive bias, but watch for multiple compression and capex digestion signals)

**Sector Sentiment:** Strong Bullish  
**Risk Profile:** High (concentrated in AI infrastructure; vulnerable to macro rate moves)
