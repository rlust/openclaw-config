## 🔥 Top 8 Tickers — One-Line Thesis

| Ticker | Sector | Thesis |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **NVDA** | Chips | CUDA ecosystem + Blackwell ramp creates the widest moat in semis; data center revenue still growing 70%+ YoY despite massive base |
| **VST** | Power/Utilities | Largest independent power producer with 5+ GW of contracted AI data center load; positioned for 3-5 years of 15%+ earnings CAGR |
| **VRT** | Cooling | Vertiv dominates liquid cooling/thermal management for hyperscale DCs; ~50% market share in AI rack power/cooling stacks |
| **ANET** | Networking | Arista's 400G/800G switching dominance in AI back-end networks; eating Cisco's lunch in hyperscale white-box adoption |
| **AVGO** | Chips/Networking | Custom AI silicon (XPUs) + Broadcom's VMware integration = two shots on goal for AI infra build-out |
| **EQIX** | Data Centers | Interconnection moat + AI inference edge positioning; rare REIT with pricing power and sub-20x AFFO multiple |
| **CEG** | Nuclear/Power | Constellation's nuclear fleet re-rating on AI demand; 10+ year PPAs signed with hyperscalers for clean baseload |
| **PLTR** | Software Infra | AIP (AI Platform) becoming standard for defense + commercial workloads; government moat expanding into industrial |

## 📰 Overnight / Week Catalysts

- **Nvidia GTC 2026** (March 17-21) approaching — Blackwell Ultra and Rubin roadmap details expected; historically catalyst for semis
- **Microsoft's $80B FY26 capex guidance** reiterated at Morgan Stanley TMT conference — Azure AI buildout remains on track
- **DOE Loan Guarantees** for nuclear/smooth reactors ($10B+ program) — benefits CEG, VST, and SMR plays like OKLO
- **European AI Sovereignty push** — France's €100B AI investment plan announced; watch ANET/EQIX international expansion
- **China AI chips** — DeepSeek's efficiency gains spooked some NVDA positioning but validates demand for inference-optimized silicon

## ⚠️ Valuation & Risk Watchouts

| Risk | Tickers Affected | Mitigation |
|------|-----------------|------------|
| **Multiple compression** | NVDA (PE ~55x), PLTR (PE ~150x) | Any sign of DC capex cuts = 20%+ drawdown; size accordingly |
| **China export restrictions** | NVDA, AMD, AVGO | Blackwell sales already constrained; watch for expanded bans |
| **Power project delays** | VST, CEG | Transmission interconnection queues are 3-5 years; execution risk on timelines |
| **Competition from custom silicon** | NVDA, ANET (partially) | MSFT/GOOGL/AMZN developing in-house; long-term margin pressure |
| **REIT rate sensitivity** | EQIX, DLR | 10-year Treasury >4.5% compresses AFFO multiples further |

## 🕵️ Under-the-Radar Pick

**NOV (NOV Inc.)** — Oil services company pivoting into geothermal drilling for data center cooling + closed-loop liquid cooling systems. 
- Trades at ~8x EBITDA vs peers at 12x+
- Partnered with major hyperscalers on geothermal DC projects
- Geothermal + nuclear becoming preferred "clean baseload" for AI DCs
- *Risks:* Energy transition volatility, commodity exposure

## 📋 Watchlist for Follow-Up

| Ticker | Trigger to Watch | Why Interesting |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **ARM** | Server CPU market share gains | Licensing moat but valuation stretched; entry on pullback to $90-100 |
| **MRVL** | Custom AI ASIC wins beyond AMZN | Optical DSP leader; 800G optical ramp underway |
| **SMCI** | Governance resolved / auditor clarity | If/when it re-lists, liquid cooling integration is best-in-class |
| **OKLO** | First SMR deployment contract | High conviction on small modular reactors; binary outcome stock |
| **WOLF** | SiC production ramp + auto stabilization | SiC for EVs + AI power supplies; trading near cash if execution fails |
| **NET** | Workers AI platform traction | Edge inference play; could be PLTR-like compounding story |

## Summary Positioning

- **Core positions:** NVDA, VST, VRT, ANET — the four horses of the AI build-out with clearest moats
- **Cyclical exposure:** AVGO, CEG — rate/earnings sensitivity but strong asymmetric upside
- **Valuation discipline:** EQIX offers REIT exposure at digestible multiples; PLTR requires strong conviction on AIP
- **Dry powder:** Keep 20-30% cash/bonds for the inevitable AI capex digestion period (2027-2028 likely)
