# Daily Log — February 14, 2026 (Valentine's Day)

## OpenClaw & System Changes
- **Updated OpenClaw to v2026.2.13** (was 2026.2.12). Key new features: write-ahead delivery queue (no lost messages after restarts), image-only messages now reach agent, better threading.
- **Model config updated:**
  - Primary: `anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5` (direct chat)
  - Fallback #1/#2: `ollama/llama3.2:latest` → `ollama/deepseek-coder:6.7b` (free local)
  - Heartbeat: `ollama/llama3.2:latest`
  - Ollama provider registered with all 4 local models
- **Fixed heartbeat "Unknown model: ollama/llama3.2"** — added Ollama provider config + auth profile
- **Brave Search API key** is invalid (422 errors) — web search broken, need new key
- **GitHub config backup:** pushed to `github.com/rlust/openclaw-config`
- **Mac mini node updated** to v2026.2.13 companion app
- **Camera snap** still blocked on Mac mini — need to enable in OpenClaw app Settings → General → Allow Camera. The `camera.snap` command isn't advertised until that toggle is on. Randy has OBSBOT Tiny 2 Lite + IoT Camera connected.

## RV-C Bridge Project (NEW — major project started today)
- **GitHub repo created:** `github.com/rlust/rv-c-bridge` (private)
  - `docs/architecture.md` — CAN decoder pipeline spec
  - `docs/hardware-v0.1.md` — dual CAN + Ethernet architecture
  - `docs/rvc-pgns.md` — PGN reference table (10 key PGNs)
  - `docs/pinmap-v0.1.md` — STM32H743 LQFP100 pin map (CAN1/CAN2/RMII/debug)
  - `hardware/bom-v0.1.csv` — 24-component BOM with part numbers
  - `firmware/` — C skeleton (decoder, pgn.h, main.c)
  - `homeassistant/` — HA custom component skeleton
  - 7 open GitHub Issues for Phase 1 milestones
- **Design decisions made:**
  - **2 CAN channels** (CAN1=RV-C house bus, CAN2=chassis/aux)
  - **Ethernet-first** (not WiFi)
  - **Read/Write capable** with TX safety gate (default monitor-only)
  - **MCU:** STM32H743VIT6 LQFP100
  - **CAN transceivers:** TI ISO1042 (isolated) ×2
  - **Ethernet PHY:** DP83825
  - **Dev path:** Use existing Pi + CAN HAT on Aspire to validate PGNs first, then build custom hardware
- **Kanban board** (localhost:9999) updated with 12 RV-C tasks
- **IRS expense tracking:** Apple Note created "RV-C Bridge Project — IRS Expense Log"; CSV at `workspace/rv-c-bridge-expenses.csv`

## Kanban Board Status (end of day)
- **In Progress:** "Get Pi SocketCAN + decoder running on existing setup" (due Feb 18), Hardware architecture v0.1
- **Done:** GitHub repo + docs, Lust Rentals Tax Reporting (filed with accountant Feb 14)
- **Backlog:** 10 RV-C Phase 1 tasks

## Home Automation
- **Kitchen lights** turned off via HA command (RV-C via MQTT/Node-RED already working on Aspire!)
- HA entities confirmed: `light.kitchen_vanity_h`, `light.kitchen_ceiling`
- Aspire runs RV-C via MQTT + Node-RED already — great foundation for the bridge project

## Randy's Day
- Valentine's Day in Naples, FL
- Workout in evening
- Shower ~5:45 PM
- Active on MacBook Pro + Mac mini via Talk Mode
- Very productive project planning day

## Open Items / Next Session
- [ ] Fix Brave Search API key (422 invalid)
- [ ] Enable camera snap in OpenClaw mac app (Settings → General → Allow Camera)
- [ ] Tell me Pi model + CAN HAT model so I can write exact SocketCAN setup commands
- [ ] Continue RV-C firmware CAN RX skeleton + KiCad schematic
