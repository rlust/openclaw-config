# Feb 10, 2026 - Repo Sync & Docs Snapshot

## Highlights
- Committed latest Lust Rentals backups plus new iCloud sync script directly in `lust-rentals-v2`; pushed upstream (commit 3c9d982) to keep production data mirrored.
- Added comprehensive reporting generator module (`src/reporting/comprehensive_reports.py`) and three supporting docs outlining Excel fixes, recovery steps, and a quick reference card; logged Feb 8-9 daily summaries for historical context; pushed main repo (commit 3d65455).
- Scheduled twice-daily Home Assistant reports (9:30 AM & 7 PM) that now compile Aspire + Newark readings with `ollama/llama3.2` and send the write-up via Apple Messages to Randy’s iPhone (740-641-5881) signed “HAL.”
- Installed `deepseek-coder:6.7b` in Ollama for local coding tasks; confirmed it runs but needs file contents pasted when summarizing (no direct filesystem access).

## Status / Follow-ups
- Everything clean in both repos after pushes; no pending git work.
- Next: leverage the new reporting generator for Phase 1 Excel output when requested and reference the new docs for Lust Rentals ops.
- Monitor new cron jobs’ Apple Messages delivery logs and consider adding `phi3` or `llama3.2:7b` to Ollama library for broader coverage.
