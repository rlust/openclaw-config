# 2026-02-12

- Fixed RVC integration availability: lights/switches/locks/covers now default to 0s timeout; added config-entry migration + tagged v2.1.4.
- Addressed awning/slide command bug by publishing to both Node-RED topic and direct DC_DIMMER_COMMAND_2 topic; patched cover.js further to guard hass None + richer payload; tagged v2.1.5.
- Hourly heartbeats at 09:30, 10:30, 11:30, 12:30 confirmed Newark temps/security stable, no rate-limit alerts.
- Gained SSH access to HA RV host (192.168.100.234, root/rc514131), tailed logs, and verified commands; saw `hass is None` runtime errors, dispatched fix.
