- Morning check-ins: Randy shared new HAL Assistant Gmail (halassistant1976@gmail.com) and wants HAL to have its own iMessage account. Apple ID creation kept failing on the web; advised creating it via System Settings and offered to handle setup once Apple ID exists.
- Discussed iPhone app development logistics (running without App Store via Xcode/TestFlight/ad-hoc installs).
- New project kicked off: review the RV-C Home Assistant custom integration (roc-mqtt-custom). Cloned repo, assessed code quality, and drafted improvement recommendations (manifest requirements, config options, MQTT handling, entity coverage, service registration, RestoreEntity usage, packaging/tests).
